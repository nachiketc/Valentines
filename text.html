            <p class="fancy-text">I love you, mera shonu monu. I appreciate you deeply, and I am truly proud of how far you havve come and the effort you have put into working on yourself.
                 You think deeply and you feel deeply too, and that is something I respect so much about you.</p>

            <p class="fancy-text">When I think about you, I don't think of big words or big gestures. I just feel like loving you, caring for you, and being there for you in the ways that matter every day.
                 I know I have a partner who understands the world really well, and that is something no one can ever take away from you.</p>
            <p class="fancy-text">You are so beautiful and strong like a rose. I love all parts of you the beautiful and the thorny. I will keep loving you and taking care of you.</p>
